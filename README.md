# Website Testing QA Application

A comprehensive quality assurance testing system for websites that performs both functional and non-functional testing using specialized testers.

## 🎯 Overview

This application provides automated website testing capabilities with two specialized testers:

1. **FunctionalTester**: Expert in software quality assurance, responsible for verifying all functional aspects of websites
2. **NonFunctionalTester**: Specialist in performance, security, and accessibility testing

## 🚀 Features

### Functional Testing
- Website navigation verification
- Clickable elements testing (links, buttons, navigation)
- Form inspection and submission testing
- User flow verification
- API endpoint testing
- Bug documentation and reporting

### Non-Functional Testing
- Performance measurement (load time, response time, page size)
- Security scanning (headers, HTTPS, vulnerabilities)
- Accessibility auditing (alt text, headings, labels, ARIA)
- Responsiveness testing (desktop, mobile, tablet)
- API security testing

### Reporting
- Comprehensive JSON report generation
- Issue categorization by severity and type
- Actionable recommendations
- Summary statistics

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Chrome browser (for Selenium testing)
- Internet connection

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
   ```
   TARGET_WEBSITE=http://mission-codex.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   BROWSER_HEADLESS=true
   BROWSER_TIMEOUT=30
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

### What the application does:

1. **Initializes both testers**
2. **Runs functional tests:**
   - Navigates to the target website
   - Tests all clickable elements
   - Validates forms and user flows
   - Tests API endpoints

3. **Runs non-functional tests:**
   - Measures performance metrics
   - Performs security scans
   - Conducts accessibility audits
   - Tests responsiveness
   - Validates API security

4. **Generates comprehensive report:**
   - Combines all findings
   - Categorizes issues by severity
   - Provides actionable recommendations
   - Saves detailed JSON report

## 📊 Output

The application provides:

1. **Real-time console output** showing test progress
2. **Comprehensive summary** with issue counts and severity levels
3. **Detailed JSON report** saved to file with timestamp
4. **Exit codes** indicating overall test status:
   - `0`: All tests passed
   - `1`: Critical issues found
   - `2`: High priority issues found
   - `3`: Medium/low issues found

## 🔧 Configuration

### Target Website
Edit `config.py` or set environment variable:
```python
TARGET_WEBSITE = "http://your-website.com/"
```

### API Testing
The application includes testing for the review API endpoint:
```python
API_ENDPOINT = "http://13.204.81.166:8080/api/v1/review"
```

### Test Data
The application uses predefined test data for API testing, including:
- Pull request URLs for review functionality
- GitHub repository references
- API key authentication
- Review request payloads
